          Goa is a state in western India with coastlines
          stretching along the Arabian <br />
          Sea. Its long history as a Portuguese colony prior
          to 1961 is evident in its<br />
          preserved 17th-century churches and the area’s
          tropical spice plantations. <br />
          Goa is also known for its beaches, ranging from
          popular stretches at Baga <br />
          and Palolem to those in laid-back fishing villages
          such as Agonda<br />
